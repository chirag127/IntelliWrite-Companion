## Project Overview
The Wordtune Browser Extension is an AI-powered writing assistant integrated into Chrome, Firefox, and Edge browsers. It enhances writing by offering features like paraphrasing, grammar correction, text generation, translation, and tone customization, all while ensuring minimal plagiarism and resistance to AI detection. The extension operates seamlessly on websites, providing a distraction-free, accessible, and high-performance user experience. The backend, powered by the Gemini AI model, handles AI requests efficiently, with data stored in MongoDB and deployed on Render.com. This masterplan outlines the development of a production-ready product, not an MVP, with comprehensive documentation, testing, and maintenance strategies.

## Project Goals
- Deliver a seamless, intuitive writing assistant that enhances user productivity across major browsers.
- Ensure high-performance AI features with response times under 500ms and minimal extension load time.
- Provide a secure, accessible, and maintainable solution with robust error handling and scalability.

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: JavaScript, React (for UI components), WebExtensions API, Tailwind CSS (styling).
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, Gemini AI (via provided integration code), MongoDB (database).
- **Database**: MongoDB (NoSQL, flexible for user preferences and temporary data).
- **Deployment**: Render.com (Platform-as-a-Service for backend), Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons, Microsoft Edge Add-ons (for extension).

## Project Scope

## Implementation Plan
The implementation plan leverages MCP servers (mentalmodel, designpattern, programmingparadigm, debuggingapproach, collaborativereasoning, decisionframework, metacognitivemonitoring, scientificmethod, structuredargumentation, visualreasoning, sequentialthinking) for structured problem-solving and robust development.

### Phase 1: Setup & Foundation
- **Task 1**: Initialize project structure with `extension/` and `backend/` folders (sequentialthinking_clear_thought for step-by-step setup).
- **Task 2**: Configure Webpack for extension bundling and Node.js/Express for backend (designpattern_clear_thought for modular architecture).
- **Task 3**: Set up MongoDB and Render.com deployment pipeline (decisionframework_clear_thought for evaluating deployment options).

### Phase 2: Core Functionality
- **Task 1**: Implement content scripts for text selection and context menu integration (programmingparadigm_clear_thought using event-driven programming).
- **Task 2**: Develop backend API with single endpoint for Gemini AI requests (services/gemini.js using provided code) (mentalmodel_clear_thought for API integration patterns).
- **Task 3**: Build React-based popup UI with Tailwind CSS for paraphrase and grammar features (visualreasoning_clear_thought for UI layout design).

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- **Task 1**: Add text generation, translation, and tone customization features (collaborativereasoning_clear_thought for integrating diverse AI outputs).
- **Task 2**: Implement plagiarism minimization and AI detection resistance logic (scientificmethod_clear_thought for hypothesis testing on text uniqueness).
- **Task 3**: Ensure cross-browser compatibility (debuggingapproach_clear_thought using divide-and-conquer for browser-specific issues).

### Phase 4: Testing & Refinement
- **Task 1**: Write unit tests for API services and UI components (metacognitivemonitoring_clear_thought for assessing test coverage).
- **Task 2**: Conduct integration tests for frontend-backend communication (structuredargumentation_clear_thought for validating data flow).
- **Task 3**: Perform end-to-end tests simulating user workflows (sequentialthinking_clear_thought for test case design).

### Phase 5: Deployment & Documentation
- **Task 1**: Deploy backend to Render.com and extension to Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons, and Edge Add-ons (decisionframework_clear_thought for deployment strategy).
- **Task 2**: Generate SVG assets and convert to PNG using sharp library (scripts/asset-generation.js) (visualreasoning_clear_thought for asset optimization).
- **Task 3**: Write README.md, CHANGELOG.md, and API documentation (structuredargumentation_clear_thought for clear, logical documentation).

## API Endpoints
- `POST /api/ai` – Handles all AI requests (paraphrase, grammar, text generation, translation, tone adjustment). Parameters: `{ feature: string, input: string, tone?: string, language?: string }`.
- `GET /api/health` – Checks backend service status.

## Data Models
### UserPreferences
- `userId`: String – Unique identifier for user (generated locally, no authentication).
- `tone`: String – Preferred writing tone (e.g., Casual, Formal).
- `language`: String – Preferred translation language (e.g., English, Spanish).

### TemporaryData
- `sessionId`: String – Temporary session identifier.
- `inputText`: String – User input for AI processing.
- `outputText`: String – AI-generated output.

## Environment Variables
```
# Required environment variables
GEMINI_API_KEY=API key for Gemini AI
MONGODB_URI=Connection string for MongoDB
PORT=Backend server port (default: 3000)

# Optional environment variables
LOG_LEVEL=Logging level (default: info)
```

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Cover API services, UI components, and utility functions using Jest.
- **Integration Tests**: Validate frontend-backend communication and MongoDB interactions.
- **End-to-End Tests**: Simulate user workflows (e.g., text selection, paraphrasing) using Playwright.
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Test on Chrome, Firefox, and Edge to ensure compatibility.
- **Performance Testing**: Measure AI response times and extension load times.

## Deployment Strategy
- **Backend**: Deploy to Render.com with automatic scaling for 1,000–10,000 users. Use MongoDB Atlas for managed database hosting.
- **Extension**: Publish to Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons, and Microsoft Edge Add-ons. Use CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions) for automated builds and deployments.
- **Asset Generation**: Run `scripts/asset-generation.js` to convert SVGs to PNGs during build.

## Maintenance Plan
- Schedule quarterly updates to add features based on user feedback.
- Monitor Render.com and MongoDB Atlas for performance and uptime.
- Apply security patches and update dependencies monthly.
- Maintain CHANGELOG.md with semantic versioning.

## Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Gemini AI rate limits | Delays in AI responses | Medium | Implement caching for frequent requests and retry logic. |
| Cross-browser inconsistencies | Broken features | Medium | Use WebExtensions API and test extensively on all browsers. |
| High backend latency | Poor user experience | Low | Optimize API endpoint and use Render.com’s autoscaling. |

## Future Enhancements
- Support additional languages for translation.
- Add offline mode for basic grammar corrections.
- Integrate with cloud storage (e.g., Google Drive) for saving user preferences.

## Development Guidelines
- **Code Quality**: Follow SOLID, DRY, and KISS principles. Use ESLint and Prettier for code consistency.
- **Frontend**: Build modular React components with Tailwind CSS. Ensure WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance.
- **Backend**: Centralize API URLs in `config/api.js`. Use try-catch for error handling in Gemini AI calls.
- **Documentation**: Maintain README.md with setup instructions and API key requirements. Update CHANGELOG.md for each release.
- **Asset Handling**: Generate PNG assets from SVGs using sharp library in `scripts/`.
- **MCP Servers**: Use `context7` for library selection, `mentalmodel_clear_thought` for problem-solving, and other clear thought servers as outlined in the implementation plan.

## Conclusion
The Wordtune Browser Extension is a powerful, user-friendly writing assistant that leverages Gemini AI to deliver advanced writing features across Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. This masterplan provides a clear, production-ready blueprint for development, with a focus on performance, accessibility, and maintainability. By following the outlined plan and leveraging MCP servers, the product will meet user needs and scale effectively.
