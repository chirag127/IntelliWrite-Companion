    *   Seamless integration with the user's writing workflow.
    *   Clear feedback for all user actions and system statuses.
*   **7.4. Reliability / Availability:**
    *   Extension should function consistently across supported browsers/sites.
    *   Graceful handling of API errors or backend unavailability.
    *   Backend service should aim for high availability.
*   **7.5. Security:**
    *   User's Gemini API key stored in `chrome.storage.local`.
    *   All communication between the extension and the backend must use HTTPS.
    *   Backend must not log or store user API keys or processed content.
    *   Users should be advised on the importance of securing their own API keys.
*   **7.6. Accessibility:**
    *   Not a primary focus for this version, but obvious improvements (e.g., basic keyboard navigation for extension UI, reasonable color contrast) should be considered and implemented where feasible without significant effort.

**8. Project Structure**
The project will be organized as follows:
*   `extension/`: Contains all code for the Chrome browser extension (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
*   `backend/`: Contains all code for the backend service (e.g., Node.js, Python, or other suitable language for proxying API requests).

**9. High-Level Technical Stack Recommendations**
*   **Frontend (extension/):**
    *   Chrome Extension Manifest V3
    *   HTML, CSS, JavaScript
    *   (Consider a lightweight framework like Preact/Vue if UI complexity grows, or vanilla JS for simplicity)
*   **Backend (backend/):**
    *   Node.js with Express.js is recommended due to JavaScript synergy with the extension and efficient handling of I/O-bound operations (like API proxying). Alternatively, Python (Flask/FastAPI) or Go.
    *   The backend will implement logic similar to the provided Gemini JS snippet to interact with the Gemini API, managing API key, model (`gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17`), configuration (`thinkingConfig`, `responseMimeType`), and streaming.
*   **AI Model:** Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview 04-17.
*   **API Key Storage:** `chrome.storage.local`.

**10. Conceptual Data Model (Client-Side)**
Stored in `chrome.storage.local`:
```json
{
  "geminiApiKey": "USER_PROVIDED_API_KEY_STRING",
  "defaultTone": "Casual", // Or other selected tone
  "preferredSourceLang": "auto", // For translation
  "preferredTargetLang": "en", // Default target, user-selectable
  "featureToggles": { // Example, if automatic features were added
    // "autoGrammarCheck": true
  },
  "recentActivity": [
    // { "type": "paraphrase", "input": "...", "output": "...", "timestamp": ... },
    // { "type": "generate", "prompt": "...", "output": "...", "timestamp": ... }
  ]
}
```
